- Using Source Code Pro for font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro
- Does not have a Keybind List currently. Working on something, not sure if I'll share. So '?' does nothing currently.
- Only provided the necessary example(s) to reference and create more.
- Made since I found no v2 of (https://github.com/plul/Public-AutoHotKey-Scripts) and something simple to edit.
