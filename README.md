- Using Source Code Pro for font: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro
- Does not have a Keybind List currently. Working on something, not sure if I'll share. So '?' does nothing currently.
- Only provided the necessary example(s) to reference and create more.
- Made since I found no v2 of (https://github.com/plul/Public-AutoHotKey-Scripts) and something simple to edit.

Notepad++ AutoHotKey Syntax Highlighing.
- Edited (https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=50)
- Made for darker themes/backgrounds so probably wont look good on light/white backgrounds. 
--- I'm using: https://github.com/nordtheme/notepadplusplus
--- It's very easy to edit the colors. Open .xml with editor and it will be self explanatory. Look at the bottom.
